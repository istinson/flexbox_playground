### Flexbox Playground

- This is a simple application to help teach basic
  methods of flexbox design in CSS. 

- Rather than another tutorial this is an attempt
  to create an interactive tool to allow students
  to toggle CSS properties and observe the effects
  on the DOM elements.

- To use the tool:
  - Fork the repo to your Github
  - Clone it down to your local machine
  - Open index.html in you browser
